Things to do at the beginning of a year:
- Update scripts/WeekVars.txt
- Add rows to the "Leagues" table for each of the new leagues
- Update homepage.js to include the previous years champions and new rule info
- Run "UpdateTables.py" to grab all of the teams from each league (once the leagues are filled) -- normally this runs sunday night
- Add the new year as a dropdown option in standings.js and make it the default
- Add the new year (and previous playoffs) as options in leaders.js
- Uncomment the /etc/crontab lines for OTH (only do this the day the season starts)
